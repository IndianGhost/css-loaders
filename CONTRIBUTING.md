# CONTRIBUTING
First of all, thank you for considering making a contribution to the CSS loaders. For this, you can simply follow the same coding style I followed.
Any improve, optimization or correction are welcomed.

# Guidelines
To add a new loader:
- Add to your HTML code after you finish coding an attribute `hidden`.
- Keep the related CSS together at the same order as HTML order.
- Use variables for color codes.
- Create a new branch and make a pull request
That's all! Thank you in advance for following these simple guidelines.
